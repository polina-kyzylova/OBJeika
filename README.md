# About
OBJeika is a mobile app designed for children aged preschool and elementary school. Its primary goal is to educate children on how to behave safely in situations that could pose a risk to their lives and health. 
Thanks to its vibrant visuals, charismatic characters, and detailed mechanics, OBJeika will be able to engage children and serve as an excellent tool for navigating emergency situations.

# Business card website
For the purpose of facilitating the monitoring of children's progress in the game, a website has been developed in the form of a business card to address the common needs and concerns of parents:
<ul>
  <li>Purchase of additional game content and chapters</li>
  <li>Monitoring a child's progress in the mobile game through a personal account</li>
  <li>Access to instructions and videos demonstrating how to play the game</li>
  <li>Communicating with the game developers to address any issues that arise</li>
  <li>Access to a community of other game players where thoughts, ideas, and experiences can be shared</li>
</ul>
